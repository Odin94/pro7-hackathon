# Beam Me Up
A project created at the Pro7-Sat1 Code24 Hackathon

## Functionality

When you get invited to an event, scan an NXP NFC tag on the invitation with your phone to automatically book a car2go, display travel data for your destination and environment & entertainment information from Pro7 and 7sport APIs. In addition, your host will be notified of your ETA as soon as you enter the car.
